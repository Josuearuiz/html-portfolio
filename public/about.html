<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Josh! Welcome to my home on the web. I'm a web designer and developer
  living in downtown Pomona. With a degree in computer information systems, I'm
  all about creating cool web and mobile experiences. When I'm not coding,
  you'll find me gaming, dancing, exploring new tech, or hanging out with my
  awesome grey tabby, Wolfie. Check out my portfolio to see what I've been
  tinkering with!
